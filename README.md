# Firmware-Downloader

Download and extract OFW on your switch's SD card! This doesn't actually install the firmware, you'd still need to run ChoiDojourNX for that. SX OS users might as well just run [blawar](https://github.com/blawar)'s [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io/Download) for an AIO solution to download and install any firmware.

----

# Install

Download the the latest release from [here](https://github.com/JackInTheShop/atmosphere-updater/releases).

Move the downloaded .nro onto you nintendo switch sd card inside the folder **/switch/firmware-downloader**.

This app extracts OFW files to /OFW/ for installation with ChoiDojourNX. It will add rajkosto's ChoiDojourNX.nro to /switch/ChoiDojourNX/ if one does not already exist.

That's it!

----

# Usage

__**The app currently has 2 options.**__

**Download latest Official Firmware files:**

* Downloads OFW 9.0.1 and extracts it to /OFW/

**Download previous Official Firmware files:**

* Downloads OFW 8.1.0 and extracts it to /OFW/
* Useful if you need to roll-back for supporting older homebrew or themes.
